# decentralized-power-control

This GitHub repository synthesized channel gain data under Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami, Weibull fading environments, reimplemented the primary heuristic power allocation algorithms in the paper _Deep Convex Learning of Decentralized Power Control for 3GPP Heterogeneous Wireless Networks_ (submitted to JSAC 2023), and constrast its performance against the ground truth found by a naive complete "grid search".
